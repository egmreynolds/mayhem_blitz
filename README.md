##### Obviously needs a better name

## Game overview:
#### Dominion-like deck builder meets competitive card game meets random chance.
Deal damage and invest in your army through a series of battles to ultimately become the winner.

How to play:
Start with set of generic small deck of cards.
Each player draws a hand of 5 cards from which they will select 3 to play face down in front of them in an order of your choice.
Each card played 'faces-off' against the opponents respective card, the winner earns gold (1), the loser's cards ability is activated.
Each players "army" - sum of played cards attack power - faces off and the loser takes the difference in damage to their HP.
If a player reaches 0 HP, their opponent wins.
A purchase phase after each round allows players to buy a card from the communal supply with the gold they have earned and add this card to their discard pile.
All cards in play and in hand are discarded.
A new round begins. <Discard piles are shuffled into decks when decks are empty>.
